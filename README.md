# How it works

## New Experiment is received
- Create Experiment
    - Experiment has between 2-4 options
    - Experiment may have 0-1 votes (if the creator already voted)
    - Experiment has an end date/time
## Experiment is shared with someone
- Creator enters a person's email address
- Add the person as a Participant (?) on the Experiment
    - Experiments can't close until all Participants have completed
- Send an email to the Participant
## Participant votes
- Participant uses link to create a session. 
    - There are no accounts (usernames/passwords) but all Experiments are forever associated with a set of Persons
- Particpant chooses one of the 2-4 options
- Participant can't see the outcome until Experiment closes
    - All Ps have voted, or E time has passed
## Experiment ends
- All Participants have voted
- Experiment end time has passed
- Calculate the outcome
    - If an option has received the most votes, it wins
    - In the event of a tie, flip a coin!
- Notify everyone
